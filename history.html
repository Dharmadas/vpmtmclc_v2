                <h1>Legal Education in Thane: An Aspiration Fulfilled</h1>
                <p>Vidya Prasarak Mandal, the parent body of this college, was founded way back in 1935. However, the real impetus to all its activities came only on 29th September, 1957 when Dr. V. N. Bedekar was elected as the President of V.P.M in the historic annual general meeting held on that day.</p>
                <p>
                The birth centenary of the great national leader Lokmanya Tilak was being celebrated in the then Bombay Province during the year 1956. Lokmanya Tilak's seminal contribution to the field of education was discussed and pondered over by a few visionaries in the context of the post-independence scenario with a number of new ideas. Dr. V.N. Bedekar and some of his close friends like Late. Shri Gunakar N.Joshi, Shri. K. G. Joshi, Late. 'Janakavi' P. Savlaram & Shri R.A.Kulkarni, were among such inspired souls whose capacity to cherish lofty dreams knew no bounds. That was exactly why Dr. Bedekar along with his friends decided to explore the various possibilities of widening the scope of the existing activities of the Vidya Prasarak Mandal in the field of Education.
                </p>
                <p>Foundation of Vidya Prasarak Mandal's schools & colleges: Between 1935 & 1957, despite a large number of financial & other constraints, the Vidya Prasarak Mandal had succeeded in starting and developing a primary school in Naupada area of Thane. Not shattered by the difficulties & challenges, the dedicated pioneers housed the school in a cowshed to start with & now the school has a classical building. Later a Secondary school has also been established.
                By the late sixties, there was not a single college in the district of Thane & more than two thousand students had to travel to Mumbai to pursue higher studies after higher secondary. Education became inaccessible to vast poor masses.
                </p>
                <p>
                        "If the poor cannot come to education, education must reach them"- Vivekananda. Vidya Prasarak Mandal negotiated with Pune University and the main obstacle in the path of starting the college was appropriate land to accommodate the college building. Vidya Prasarak Mandal urged the state government to come for aid and for the great cause, Maharashtra government granted a 10 acre plot of land to Vidya Prasarak Mandal where K.G.Joshi College of Arts commenced in 1969; and subsequently about 31/2 acres of contiguous land in 1978. With funds through donation by President's father Late Shri N.G. Bedekar, Commerce College was started. Enthralled by the earnest purpose, the then Chief Minister of Goa, Shri Dayanand Bandodkar donated Rs. 320,000 to Vidya Prasarak Mandal for the Science wing. In the same year 1969, all the 3 colleges had their beginning.

                <h2>The Birth of VPM's TMC Law College</h2>
                        <p>Vidya Prasarak Mandal sensitive and responsive to the educational needs and demands of the town added a new feather to its cap by starting this Law College. VPM's Law College was dedicated to the students' community in 1972. The college is named after the then Thane Municipal Council which donated a sum of Rs. 1 lakh to the college. Till 1974 the college was affiliated to Pune University. Thereafter it continues to be an affiliated college of the University of Mumbai. Professional Legal education became accessible to the people of Thane. Since then, the college has been receiving rousing response from the graduates of Thane town and around.</p>
                        <p>
                        The college is located in VPM's campus which houses a vast range of academic institutes. The college has its independent building in the campus which is in Bunder Road, Chendani, near Thane Railway Station, Thane west.
                        Up till June 1999, the college was functioning on the 'no grant basis' without financial aid from the government. However in 1999 financial aid was granted to this college with retrospective effect from 1995-96 in compliance with the 1995 Supreme Court decision .Despite that fact, the college has adequately catered to the needs of qualitative legal education. This institution has produced thousands of lawyers in the last fifty years who occupy eminent positions in various fields. This fact is ample proof to testify our service. The graduates who throng our college counters for admissions inspire us more and we are striving harder to achieve better excellence.</p>
